Everywhere , instead of \n there is \x1e and instead of space there is \x1d


Index Structure
My idea for index is that it is going to be in text form.
First it includes the number of files
121
Each file has the following structure
<full_path_and_name>(='/open/hi.txt') <blob_name>(=c22b5f9178342609428d6f51b2c5af4c0bde6a42) <exists>(=True or False) <changed>

Then is the number of directories
Each directory has the following structure
<full_path>(='/open') <tree_name>(=c22b5f9178342609428d6f51b2c5af4c0bde6a42)


Tree Structure:
<Name>
<Number of files>
....<Name of File> <Blob Name>
<Number of trees>
....<Name of Tree> <Tree Name>

Commit Structure:
<Message as text, no new lines>
<Father>
<Head Tree>
<Number of changes>
...<Change Name> <exists>
